<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I went to Indiana University where I learned a lot about web development skills.
  I'm mostly building this as a refersher to get back into web development.
</p>

<p>Web development is very interesting to me, but I also love building applications with Python.
  I know Python can also be used for data science and analytics, so one day I would like to learn that too.
  Other than that, I'm trying to get into game development as well. I think I just like building things.
</p>

<p>I like the creative aspect of coding and development. I think it's fun to solve problemes
  or create projects in ways that make them unique. Hopefully I keep up with the learning though.
